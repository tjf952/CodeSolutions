# Code Solutions

A repository of old and new solutions from various sources!

## [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I have some solutions for 2021. When I went home for the holidays, I didn't have access to the internet so I had to stop. I'll have to come back to it.

## For Fun

A collection of unique problems that I wanted to hold on to for the future.

## [Google Kick Start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart)

> Kick Start is a global online coding competition, consisting of three-hour rounds of a variety of algorithmic challenges designed by Google engineers. Participants can compete in one or all online rounds held throughout the year, and will have the opportunity to develop and grow their programming abilities while getting a glimpse into the technical skills needed for a career at Google.

Want to do more of this eventually if I could find the time.

## [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

These are really old solutions. The cpp solutions are from 2016 and 2017. The python solutions are from 2019. The main purpose to try these were curiosity. I fell off the boat on these rather quickly.
